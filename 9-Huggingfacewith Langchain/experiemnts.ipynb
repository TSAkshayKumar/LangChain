       "'?\\n\\nMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\\n\\nThe process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\\n\\nMachine learning can be categorized into three types:\\n\\n- Supervised Learning: It involves the use of labeled data, where the desired output is known. The goal is to learn a mapping between the input and output variables, so that given a new input, the model can predict the output.\\n- Unsupervised Learning: It is the process of learning without labeled data. The goal is to find the hidden pattern or structure within the data.\\n- Reinforcement Learning: It is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward or minimize a cost.\\n\\nMachine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.\\n\\nMachine learning is a powerful tool for solving complex problems and making predictions, but it requires a large amount of data, computational resources, and expertise to implement. It is an active area of research with many ongoing developments and advancements.'"
